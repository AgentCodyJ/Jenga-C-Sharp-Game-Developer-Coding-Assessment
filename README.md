## Assessment Requirements
1) Pull Jenga stack data from provided API (there are 3 stacks for 3 different grade levels).  
2) Build 3 Jenga stacks in a row using data from the API response to determine the block type:  

* Mastery = 0  ---  Glass  
* Mastery = 1  ---  Wood  
* Mastery = 2  ---  Stone  

3) Enable orbit controls on Mouse 1 hold so that the user can rotate the camera around the stack.  

* One of the 3 stacks should always be in focus by default  
* Add some control to switch the view between the 3 stacks  

4) Add an option to get more details about a specific block (e.g. on right-click).  

* Show the following details available in the API response:  
    [Grade level]: [Domain]  
    [Cluster]  
    [Standard ID]: [Standard Description]  

5) Implement the "Test my Stack" game mode, where glass blocks are removed from each Jenga stack and physics enabled.  

## Controls
* Left-click hold and move mouse = Orbit camera  
* Right-click on block = Check block info  
* Space = Remove glass blocks and toggle gravity  
* Space (2nd time) = Restart scene  
* E = Move camera focus to next Jenga stack  
* Q = Move camera focus to previous Jenga stack  

## Simple Dev Log
-Updated Unity version + created new Unity 3D Project.  
-Renamed scene to something more meaningful -> “CodyJolinMain.unity”.  
-Created 3D Object -> Plane named “Floor”.  
-Imported wood, rock, sand, and stone textures + skybox from Unity Asset Store.  
-Used Rendering -> Lighting -> Environment menu to set desert landscape skybox.  
-In same menu, created subtle red fog effect (went with linear, as exponential and exponential squared were more than I wanted).  
-Applied sand material/texture to Floor and changed its tiling to 100 so that it wouldn’t be obvious that the texture was repeating.  
&emsp;	Moved smoothness down for low reflection and added some red to the albedo value for a red tinge to match skybox.  

-Created new 3D Object -> Cube and changed its scale to (3,1,1) to make a rectangle.  
-Used materials from wooden + stone textures taken from the Asset store to create a wooden block (rectangle + wood material).   
-Adjusted the Box Collider to have values of (1.05, 1.05, 1.05), allowing for a visible gap between the blocks.   
&emsp;	Otherwise, the blocks visibly blend together, especially if they are of the same type.  
-Added Rigidbody to the block and unchecked "Use Gravity" so that the default start of the scene does not apply gravity to the Jenga stacks.  
-Created tag "Block" and applied it to the block. This will be used later to target the blocks and turn gravity back on.  
-Created a prefab out of this wooden block instance.  
-Copied the prefab two times and modified each one to create a stone block and glass block prefab.   
&emsp;	The glass block uses a standard material with Transparent Rendering Mode + Metallic around .75 and Smoothness around .45.  

-Created Readme.md to log Overview, Author information, Controls, and Simple Dev Log (this file).  

-Created C# script named “GameController.cs”.  
-Opened project in Visual Studio and began to code "GameController.cs".  
-This script handles:  
&emsp;	*API call to fetch student data  
&emsp;	*Sorting and grouping of student data  
&emsp;	*Constructing Jenga stacks at runtime based on API call data, including duplicate data check and error handling  
&emsp;&emsp;	Note: Code has been written with the flexibility of handling Grades 1-9 (i.e. more than just 3 grade stacks)  
&emsp;	*Creating Jenga stack label based upon grade (i.e. "6th Grade", "7th Grade", etc)  
&emsp;	*Logging Jenga stack debug info to Unity console  
&emsp;	*Creating camera focal point for each Jenga stack at half the stack's height  
-Attached "GameController.cs" to Main Camera and set fields in inspector.  
-Upon needing JSON conversion methods, Unity’s Package Manager “Add package from git URL” option was used to import “com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json”.   
&emsp;	This then allowed the package to be used in scripts by including “using Newtonsoft.Json”.  

-Created C# script "StudentStat.cs".  
-This script serves as an API object class for storing student stat data.  
-Implemented Equals method for custom equality comparison between StudentStat instances (used to duplicate stat detection).  
-Attached "StudentStat.cs" script to each of the wooden, stone, and glass block prefabs.  

-Created C# script named "CameraKeyboardController.cs".  
-This script handles:  
&emsp;	*Setting initial camera position/rotation with respect to the first Jenga stack  
&emsp;	*Moving camera with left-click + move mouse  
&emsp;	*Displaying block info on screen when block is right-clicked  
&emsp;	*Pressing space bar to enable gravity (1st press) or reload the scene (2nd press)  
&emsp;	*Pressing "Q" to switch camera to previous Jenga stack or "E" to switch to next stack  
-Attached "CameraKeyboardController.cs" to Main Camera and set fields in inspector.  

-Created new 3D Object -> "Text - TextMeshPro" Object named "StackLbl" to serve as the Grade Label displayed in front of each Jenga stack.   
-Adjusted the size, color, alignment, and starting position for the label and then created a prefab out of it.  
&emsp;	This prefab is used by the “GameController.cs” script to instantiate a label for each newly created stack.  

-Created new UI -> Canvas object named "UI Canvas" to hold the UI text for player controls and block student stat information.  
&emsp;	Note: Unity automatically adds the EventSystem upon creating a UI object.  
-Set Render Mode of "UI Canvas" to "Screen Space - Overlay" so that UI text children would be displayed at all points of the game (when given text values).  
-Created new UI -> "Text - TextMeshPro" Object named "BlockStats" as a child of "UI Canvas" with a blank text value (set later by right-click a block).  
-Created new UI -> "Text - TextMeshPro" Object named "Controls" as a child of "UI Canvas" with text value set to the game controls.  
&emsp;	Controls are shown on screen at all times to the player.  
-For both UI text objects, set text position, color, size, alignment, anchor, and visible range (how much of the screen the UI text is allowed to take up).  

-During testing, the Jenga stacks spawned in with a bit of physics wobble, which led to them slowly toppling over.  
&emsp;	A quick fix for this was to enable "Adaptive Force" in the project Physics settings, which helps with stacked Rigidbodies.
